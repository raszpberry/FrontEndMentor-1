## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It is good practice to see visualization of the occupying space of your elements through the use of:

```css
.this-minimizes-my-confusion {
  border: 1px solid red;
}
```
Also, this challenge improved and practiced my usage of css variables. 

```css
:root{
    --need-more-of-these: '100%';
}
```

### Continued development

This challenge made me realize that I need to improve my use of media queries and to do a lot more of css variables as it could really help on reducing the amount of changes I need to modify.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me grasp the css variable, flexbox, and css grid. A really good website for beginners like me.
